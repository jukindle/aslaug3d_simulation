    # First, all params are initialized to their start value. Then, as soon as
    # The success rate is higher than the threshold, one of the parameters
    # p_spawn_human or wall_width[1] are adapted towards their end value in
    # a total of 10 steps. As soon as both parameters reached their end value,
    # the same procedure repeats for spawn_range_x.

    # lists, even if only a single adaption is used. The inner lists specify
    # which adaptions shall be completed before proceeding with the next
    # element in the outer list.
